Wallets are an essential part of the blockchain. They function as a way of storing our web3 assets, as a form of identity, for authentication among others. When building a Dapp knowing how to work with wallets is crucial since it is a big part of the user experience. One area that has not been covered as much is working with wallets when building mobile Dapps and in since our main goal at Weedle is promoting mobile first Dapp development, this seems like a great topic to write about.

The aim of this tutorial is to cover everything you need to know to effectively add the ability to use wallets to your mobile Dapps. The tutorial will be distributed into parts, with each part taking some more advanced topics than the last.

## First Some Dependencies

I'm assuming you already have your app ready, if you don't head over to [this article](https://blog.joinweedle.com/posts/setup-web3-react-native) to learn how to setup a react native app that is web3 compatible. 

The walletconnect documentation for react native can be found [here](https://docs.walletconnect.com/quick-start/dapps/react-native). According to the docs we need three dependencies, you can go ahead and copy the code below to install them

`yarn add @walletconnect/react-native-dapp react-native-svg @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`

However there is a small issue with this, the types in the async storage library (`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage)` specified are incompatible with walletconnect. In fact using it directly with a typescript setup will show you an error saying the type is incompatible with walletconnect.

There are a couple of solutions:

### Option 1

One option (long and difficult way) would be to get the types walletconnect expects and write an adapter that maps to those types. If you want to go via this route, you can find the file with walletconnect typings in a seperate utils github repo [here](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-utils/blob/master/misc/keyvaluestorage/src/react-native/types.ts). You can basically create a file and put the types inside it, then use it as the type for your adapter. 

### Option 2(My preferred option)

Is fast and dirty. Basically examining the [keyvaluestorage](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-utils/blob/master/misc/keyvaluestorage/src/react-native/index.ts) functions from walletconnect you will see that they are not only making use of a very small set of functions from the async storage library. To get the correct types we can use the types referred to in option 1 and just cast it to the asyncStorage props from walletconnect provider.

I prefer this method since walletconnect isn't using any significant number of functions from the library, so mapping all functions just because a few are being used doesn't make sense to me. This can be seen as a temporary measure at least till this issue has been fixed by the WalletConnect team.



## Integrate WalletConnect with our App

According to the docs we have two ways of using WalletConnect. We can either use it as a provider or as a Higher order component; lets stick with the provider method. The provider takes a couple of props, but only two of them are compulsory, there are default values provided for the other props which is sufficient for our use case.

Say our app currently looks like this

```typescript
<View style={styles.mainContainer}>
  <MainApp />
</View>
```

To enable wallectconnect, we can just need to wrap the app in its provider like so

```typescript
<WalletConnectProvider
  redirectUrl={`wmw://app`} // Explained below
  storageOptions={{
    asyncStorage: AsyncStorage as unknown as IAsyncStorage,
  }}>
  <View style={styles.mainContainer}>
    <MainApp />
  </View>
</WalletConnectProvider>
```

The value in the storageOptions was explained earlier, as for the `redirectUrl ` this is a deep link url that walletconnect redirects to after validation. More on that [here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/linking/#universaldeep-links-without-a-custom-scheme). My preferred method of handling the redirect url would be to redirect to a view where I can verify if the user has been authenticated or not, preferrably back to the current page where the user tried to login using their wallet. 

Now that we have wrapped our app with the walletconnect provider, lets look at how we can authenticate using walletconnect. To explain this, lets say inside `MainApp` we have two components, `Auth` and `Dashboard.` We want to only show dashboard after authenticating the user

```typescript
// Auth.tsx
import React, {useState} from 'react'
import WalletConnectProvider, { useWalletConnect } from '@walletconnect/react-native-dapp';
...
 
const Auth = () => {
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const connector = useWalletConnect(); // Wallet connect hook
  ...
  
  // Note: for example purposes only, do better and split your components into files properly
  return (
    <View>
    {
      !isConnected ? 
        <View> 
          <Button title='Wallet connect' onPress={authenticateUser} />
        </View> :
        <Dashboard />
    }
    </View>
  )
}
```

In the code above, we are doing a couple of things.

* `useWalletConnect` - This hook provides a connector object for
