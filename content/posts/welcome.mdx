To say that blockchain technology has changed the world would be an understatement. Although the concept is simple and the idea feels like something that word that has always been on the tip of your tongue but you just can't remember, the impact has been nothing short of revolutionary.

But as amazing as this technology is, it is not without its problems. For one, mass adoption is still a problem, another would be the decentralized nature that has allowed quite a lot of bad actors' prey on unsuspecting people. 

## Mass Adoption

So many organizations and individuals in the blockchain space are doing all they can to onboard more people into the space. From education materials to big spending on ads and so much more. Some key mentions include **crypto.com** becoming a 2022 Fifa world cup sponsor, stadiums and playing arenas being named after some organizations, and even a **Binance** sponsoring the African cup of nations.

As much as the ads are helping spread the word and doing some good, you can't help but feel some foundational issues are yet to be addressed. A major foundational problem is that the **user experience** (UX) for blockchain products is broken. In part, this is due to the nature of how the technology is built, another reason can be attributed to the teams behind blockchain products rushing to market without being bothered about how to make the product better or easier to use for the users. 

To achieve mass adoption, blockchain and crypto products need to be more intuitive, purpose-built and the team's responsible need to care more about the users, than making a quick buck. One good example of a broken UX that comes to mind is how most projects ask the user to re-configure their wallets when switching to another blockchain network, even if it's EVM compatible e.g. Switching from Ethereum to Polygon. Another example that is even much more vital and I believe is most crucial to achieving mass adoption is the idea of building for computers and web users.

## Fixing the UX

Now that we have established that the UX is broken with reasons, let's show some proof.

One technology that brought about the mass adoption of the internet, even in some less advanced areas of the world has been smartphone devices. Looking at the diagram above, you can see how mobile traffic to the internet has gradually overtaken computers over the years. Smartphones ha
