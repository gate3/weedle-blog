To say that blockchain technology has changed the world would be an understatement. Although the concept is simple and the idea feels like something that word that has always been on the tip of your tongue but you just can't remember, the impact has been nothing short of revolutionary.

But as amazing as this technology is, it is not without its problems. For one, mass adoption is still a problem, another would be the decentralized nature that has allowed quite a lot of bad actors' prey on unsuspecting people. 

## Mass Adoption

So many organizations and individuals in the blockchain space are doing all they can to onboard more people into the space. From education materials to big spending on ads and so much more. Some key mentions include **crypto.com** becoming a 2022 Fifa world cup sponsor, stadiums and playing arenas being named after some organizations, and even a **Binance** sponsoring the African cup of nations.

As much as the ads are helping spread the word and doing some good, you can't help but feel some foundational issues are yet to be addressed. A major foundational problem is that the **user experience** (UX) for blockchain products is broken. In part, this is due to the nature of how the technology is built, another reason can be attributed to the teams behind blockchain products rushing to market without being bothered about how to make the product better or easier to use for the users. 

To achieve mass adoption, blockchain and crypto products need to be more intuitive, purpose-built and the team's responsible need to care more about the users, than making a quick buck. One good example of a broken UX that comes to mind is how most projects ask the user to re-configure their wallets when switching to another blockchain network, even if it's EVM compatible e.g. Switching from Ethereum to Polygon. Another example that is even much more vital and I believe is most crucial to achieving mass adoption is the idea of building for computers and web users.

## Fixing the UX

Now that we have established that the UX is broken with reasons, let's show some proof.

One technology that brought about the mass adoption of the internet, even in some less advanced areas of the world has been smartphone devices. Looking at the diagram above, you can see how mobile traffic to the internet has gradually overtaken computers over the years. The mobility and the personal nature of the devices have contributed to how well the internet has been received. Mobile phones are also intuitive and are more of a personal fixture than a tool, it's more like second nature to us now. This is also why mobile phones have been responsible for more than half of how people prefer to do things like banking, study, buy goods and services, entertainment and it's even a popular choice when it comes to making use of apps and products from web2.

What does this tell us? Lets me put it like this. If 55% of internet users are mobile phone users, 42% are desktop users and the rest use tablet devices. That would mean, in every 10 people on the face of the earth about 5 use mobile phones, 4 use desktop devices and the rest use other devices. By that math, building blockchain products with mobile phones in mind first would make more sense, right?

## Our Mission

At Weedle, we took a step back and tried to figure out how we can contribute our quota to making blockchain tech and its goodies available to everyone. The answer we came up with is plain and simple, we need to fix user experiences and that starts with encouraging more people to build for mobile than desktops. This is the core of our mission. 

Our focus will be to provide the necessary tools and resources to encourage mobile adoption among builders. We want to put all you need into your hands to help you build products that will onboard the next billion users for your products and also for the blockchain space in general. We will do this by simplifying the developer experience, hence we believe this will trickle down to end-users as well. 

Follow us on this journey and support the mission by using our tools and telling others about it. Cheers
